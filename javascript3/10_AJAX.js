//basic theory
//AJAX---asynchronouse javascript and XML
//HTTP request/http call---->(hyper text transefer protocol)--->
//http request humare liye browser karta hai 
//is a set of "web developmwnt techniques"
//using many web technology on the "client - side "
//to create asynchronouse web application(http ye kam background me chalta hai web browser ke through web api karta hai)


 
//with ajax , web application can send and retrieve
//data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
//without interfering with the display and 
//behaviour of the existing page


//we don't use data in XML format anymore
//we use JSON now


//we have 3 most common ways to create and request to server
//1.)xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
//2.)fetch API(new way of doing)
//3.)axios(this is third party library)
